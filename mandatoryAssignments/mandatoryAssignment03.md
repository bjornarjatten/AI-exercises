## Task 1

The main difference between forward- and backward-chaining is that forward-chaining works from the initial state and tries to find the final state. Backward-chaining on the other hand, starts from the final state and goes back to the initial state. Backward-chaining is therefore useful for cases where we already known the outcome, but need to find out how this outcome came to be. In the book, they come up with example questions like "what shall I do now?" and "where are my keys?". Here we both know the goal states (we know that the keys are somewhere), but we do not know how the goal state came to be (we do not know how the keys ended up somewhere). This type of reasoning is called **goal direct reasoning**.
